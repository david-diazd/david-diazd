# 👋 Hey there! I'm David Díaz

I'm an aerospace engineer turned tech consultant, startup co-founder, and product builder. I'm passionate about creating useful digital tools — especially in the **SaaS**, **data-driven products**, and **micro-SaaS** space.

Currently building:

- 🧠 [**The Big Moves**](https://thebigmoves.beehiiv.com) – A newsletter tracking major moves in the stock market by banks and funds.
- 📚 A microSaaS to **validate and showcase your knowledge of books**, like a “Duolingo for serious readers.”
- 🎁 A loyalty app for physical businesses like **physiotherapy clinics, pharmacies, and cafés**, using digital cards and smart reward systems.

### 🛠️ Tech I use
- Vibe Coding: React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase  
- Python (Pandas, Jupyter), Make, Airtable  
- Beehiiv, Framer, low-code/no-code tools (FlutterFlow, Bubble) 

### 🚀 Current interests
